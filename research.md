## 3DRefTransformer
The task aims to discriminatively understand an instance of a particular 3D object described by natural language utterances among other instances of 3D objects of the same class appearing in a visual scene. We introduce the 3DRefTransformer net, a transformer-based neural network that identifies 3D objects described by linguistic utterances in real-world scenes.

## Latent Space Poisoning
It's an adversarial attack which used JointVAE architecture to search the latent space for potential examples which can fool the black box classifer. The work ended up beating PGD based defenses on various datasets (MNIST, CelebA, and SVHN) and reducing its success rate by ~70%.

## Stroke Care with AI in LMIC's
AI solution (qER) was developed to report abnormalities given a non-contrast CT (NCCT). qER compiles findings into a detailed report highlighting abnormalities, indicating affected brain region along with estimated volume for bleeds. These findings coupled with clinical symptoms helps identify stroke.

As a member of the Proactively Addressing Substandard Housing (PASH) working group, I helped draft a city ordinance proposing the [Chicago Healthy Homes Inspection Program (CHHIP)](https://www.tenants-rights.org/programs/advocacy/chhip/), a universal rental housing inspection program to protect tenants from health hazards including lead. -->

In collaboration with the IIT Delhi, Marconi Society and Google, My team developed and performed validation of a predictive model to target safety systems on edge devices. The source code is available on GitHub. Our work was reported in the [India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/delhi-college-students-win-prestigious-marconi-awards-for-apps-on-women-safety-and-checking-air-pollution-1611854-2019-10-22), [The Hindu](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/variety/delhi-students-solutions-for-womens-safety-air-pollution-bag-marconi-societys-celestini-programme-awards/article29765200.ece), and [Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/benefits-of-connectivity-students-win-marconi-awards-for-innovative-apps/1747344/) among many others.
