I am a researcher with a deep interest in developing innovative methods that push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence and its real-world applications. My primary research focuses on creating AI systems capable of compositional reasoning and robust generalization, particularly in complex, dynamic, or high-stakes environments. I am fascinated by the challenge of enabling AI to move beyond pattern recognition, toward true adaptability and abstraction, mimicking human intelligence in its ability to understand and recombine knowledge for novel scenarios.

I enjoy exploring the interplay between representation learning, multimodal integration, and interpretability, particularly in domains like healthcare and 3D vision. My work emphasizes the importance of designing models that are not only powerful but also trustworthy and aligned with specific domain needs. My current research focuses on developing AI techniques that integrate compositional understanding with robust statistical modeling to tackle challenges such as rare event detection in medical imaging and intricate object recognition in 3D scenes. These efforts align with my broader vision of building AI systems that adapt seamlessly across diverse tasks while maintaining transparency and reliability.

I have collaborated with top researcher in their field like [Prof. Mohamed H. Elhoseiny](http://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/) (3D Vision, Creative Computing, Continual Learning, NLP), [Prof. Peter Wonka](https://peterwonka.net/) (Computer Graphics, 3D Vision), [Dr. Aakanksha Chowdhery](https://www.achowdhery.com/) (Efficient AI, Large Models, Edge Computing), [Dr. Jason Tarpley](https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/people/jason-tarpley/) (Neuroscience, Surgery), [Dr. Jeyaraj Pandian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeyaraj-pandian-5a207b1b6?originalSubdomain=in) (Neuroscience, Surgery).
