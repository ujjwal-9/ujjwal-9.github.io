True intelligence is the ability to adapt to the unknown, a challenge AI has faced since its inception. I want to push AI beyond pattern recognition toward compositional reasoning which involves identifying core abstractions and combining them to make sense even in new contexts. This concept aligns with advancements in understanding of intelligence, as discussed in works like “On the Measure of Intelligence” [(François Chollet, 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547) and "Generalization without systematicity" [(Lake and Baroni, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350). 

I’m researching systems that can achieve disentangled representations of intelligence, enabling AI to break down complex information into core components for better reasoning and adaptability. I love exploring how multimodal representations—such as text, images, and sensor data—interact to form a unified and interpretable understanding of the world.

Currently, I’m developing methods that combine compositional understanding with strong statistical modeling to tackle critical challenges across multiple domains.  In medical imaging, I focus on rare disease detection, building AI systems capable of identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis and timely intervention, even in data-scarce scenarios. In 3D vision, I work on detailed object recognition in complex environments, improving AI’s ability to understand fine-grained object relationships and spatial hierarchies, even in cluttered or occluded scenes. Extending this work to cybersecurity, I focus on adaptive threat detection, enabling AI systems to recognize rare and evolving attack patterns.
