I’m a researcher exploring domains of Artificial Intelligence. My research interests include computer vision, adversarial machine learning, and representation learning.

My primary focus is to build systems that offer true disentangled abstraction of human psychology and challenges human consciousness. I plan to pursue my vision for such systems by extending my approach to reinforcement learning and non-differentiable intelligence.

I have  worked on diverse areas of AI during my internships ranging from Keyword Spotting, Multimodal Emotion Recognition to Object Detection and Segmentation

Currently, I’m working as AI scientist at [qure.ai](https://qure.ai) where we are applying deep learning on medical images. The goal is to make healthcare affordable while maintaining efficieny and effecttiveness.

<!-- I'm a research scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's [Institute for Sustainability, Energy, and Environment](https://sustainability.illinois.edu/).

My recent [research]({{site.baseurl}}/research.html) is primarily in soil carbon, water quality, and childhood lead poisoning. My methodological interests include Bayesian multilevel and spatiotemporal modeling, causal inference, targeted interventions, and experimental design.

I was previously at the University of Chicago's [Harris School of Public Policy](http://harris.uchicago.edu) and [Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://dsapp.uchicago.edu). Before that, I studied mathematics at Northwestern where my [dissertation]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/pdf/dissertation.pdf) was in the field of geometric analysis. -->
