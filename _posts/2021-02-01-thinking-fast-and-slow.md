The book revolves around two systems that drive human thought:
 
 - System 1: Fast, automatic, intuitive, and emotional. It operates effortlessly and is prone to biases and errors due to its reliance on heuristics.
 - System 2: Slow, deliberate, analytical, and logical. It requires effort and is often engaged for complex or unfamiliar problems.

Example: System 1 helps us quickly judge if someone looks angry, while System 2 is needed to solve a math problem like 17 × 24.

## Anchoring Effect

Our judgments are often influenced by arbitrary numbers or information we encounter, even when they are irrelevant to the task at hand. This is the anchoring effect.

Example: When asked to estimate the percentage of African nations in the UN, participants’ answers were influenced by spinning a wheel of fortune showing random numbers. A higher number led to higher estimates.

Anchoring occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter

## The Availability Heuristic

People judge the probability of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. This can lead to overestimating the likelihood of dramatic or recent events.

Example: Plane crashes are perceived as more frequent than they are because they receive extensive media coverage, making them easier to recall compared to car accidents, which are far more common.

## Loss Aversion

Humans feel the pain of loss more acutely than the pleasure of gain. This principle explains why people often avoid risks, even when potential rewards outweigh the risks.

Example: Losing $50 feels more painful than the pleasure gained from winning $50.

Loss aversion is a key concept in prospect theory, which explains decision-making under risk.

## The Endowment Effect

Ownership increases the perceived value of an object. People often demand much more to give up an item they own than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.

Example: A person who owns a mug might value it at $10, but if they didn’t own it, they might only be willing to pay $5 for it.

## Overconfidence Bias

People tend to overestimate the accuracy of their judgments and knowledge. This can lead to poor decision-making, especially in complex situations where uncertainty is high.

Example: Experts in fields like stock market prediction often overrate their ability to forecast trends accurately.

## The Planning Fallacy

People are overly optimistic about how much time, resources, or effort a task will take, often underestimating potential obstacles.

Example: Construction projects frequently take longer and cost more than initially planned due to this bias.

The planning fallacy is a tendency to underestimate time, costs, and risks, while overestimating benefits.

## The Halo Effect

First impressions or a single positive trait can influence how we perceive unrelated attributes of a person or situation.

Example: A competent and friendly employee might be assumed to be more capable than they actually are, just because of their warmth.

## Regression to the Mean

When outcomes are extreme, they tend to be followed by more moderate outcomes. This is not due to causation but simply statistical probability.

Example: A student who scores unusually high on a test is likely to score closer to average on subsequent tests.

These excerpts illustrate the rich insights from Thinking, Fast and Slow and highlight its relevance to understanding decision-making, biases, and human behavior. Let me know if you’d like to explore specific chapters or concepts further!
