## Presentations

[***ASPECT Scoring***](assets/pdf/ASPECTS.pdf)<br /> ASPECTS is a 10-point quantitative topographic CT scan score used for patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke.  To compute ASPECTS, 1 point is subtracted from 10 for any evidence of early ischemic change for each of the defined regions. This CT score is simple and reliable and may be helpful in the early stages of care for supporting transfer or therapy decisions.

<!-- ## Software
[*Is the Weather Weird?*](https://www.istheweatherweird.com)<br/>Jonah-Bloch Johnson and I made a website to help answer that question. Bea Malsky made a [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/itww_chicago).

[*Higher Ground*](https://github.com/potash/higher-ground)<br/>This work-in-progress uses OpenStreetMap data to analyze and visualize urban greenspace. I used it to write the above [article](articles/17/chicago-parks) about Chicago greenspace.

[*drain*](https://github.com/potash/drain)<br/>This is a simple and powerful Python framework for reproducible and parallel data science workflows.

[*collate*](https://github.com/dssg/collate)<br/>This is a Python library for generating spatiotemporal aggregation SQL queries, primarily for building features for machine learning and other models.

[*acs2pgsql*](https://github.com/dssg/acs2pgsql)<br/>This is a [drake](https://github.com/factual/drake) workflow for bulk importing the American Community Survey (ACS) data and TIGER shapefiles from the U.S. Census FTP into a PostgreSQL database.

[*dmr2pgsql*](https://github.com/dssg/il-dmr)<br/>This script downloads and imports discharge monitoring reports from the Illinois EPA website for the University of Chicago's [Environmental Law Clinic](http://www.law.uchicago.edu/clinics/environmental).

[*Visible Hand*](https://github.com/potash/visiblehand-core)<br/>This software for calculating the carbon footprint of flights and utilities by parsing e-mail receipts and integrating various aircraft and energy emissions databases.

[*Cook Scheduler*](https://github.com/potash/cook_scheduler)<br/>This python script uses linear programming to optimize the selection of a cook schedule given each cook's preferences.
